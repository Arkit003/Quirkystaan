1) can use the form directly to create the form dont have to inititate it in model
2){{form.as_p}} as_p here stands for as paragraph,we can change p also
3)form = Loginfornm in view diretly handles the get request
 but have to write ofr the Post request 
 4) if u r using login_required decorator, configure the setting.py file
 with LOGIN_URL='login' ,LOGOUT_URL='logout

5) saving images-
setting.py-> import os
setup MEDIA_URL='/media/'#for storing in the media folder
and MEDIA_ROOT= os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media/')
add the url to the urlspattern in mysite.urls
urlpatterns+= static(settings.MEDIA_URL,document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
6) if we are sumbmitting img in form we need to add attribute enctype="multipart/form-data"
7)this.id or other can be used from jquery targeting a class or id to get the element.
8)redirect uses url not html
  9){% if logged_user in post.users.all() %}
